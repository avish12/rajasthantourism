                "In this land of kings and queens, heroism and romance resound from its folklore, festivals, fashion and architecture in a fairy tale style. The magic of ‘Vibrant Rajasthan’ lies in its colorful culture, rich heritage, and rustically sweet hearts of the people. Its shining sand-dunes, a variety of forests, wetlands and wildlife in the backdrop of Aravalis-India's oldest mountain range, make your experience even more exciting. In addition to the exciting desert safari on camel back, you have the option of a safari on horses, elephants or even in jeeps. A tiger trail in the forests or watching the birds in the wetlands is another out of the world experience. And, you cannot resist being pampered with the lavish heritage properties many of which are now royal hotels.\n" +
