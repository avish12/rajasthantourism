Spread over an area of 11,117.8 square kilometres, the city is situated at a height of 430 meters. The temperature soars up to 45 degrees during summers and plummets to almost two degrees during the winter season. Ban Ganga and Sabi rivers flow through its historic terrain.

The layout of the city was planned by Vidyadhar Bhattacharya, a descendant of the Shaspati lineage. Shilpa Shastra and the Pithapada form the keystone of his vision. Jaipur has been built in alignment with rules of the grid method of construction. Nine rectangular-shaped chokris or city spheres laid out in broad, spruced up roads comprise the avant-garde architectural framework of Jaipur. Bolstered by munitions to ward off any foreign attack, Jaipur in its entire pink splendour is a fascinating spectacle to behold.\n" +
